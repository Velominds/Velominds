    Vision: High-end components and frames from mid-century and older to bring eroica velos back to the road as e-velo sweethearth. We aim at no use of raw materials and energy in the renovation process. Each velo, the physical one, connects to an NFT, the digital piece, to track the building process and to empower decentralization and sustainability for artists and riders.
