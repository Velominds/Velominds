Summary
Green power generation, storage and distribution will be composed of millions of small, decentralised power
sources of producers and consumers, the prosumers. In such systems, it will be important to connect efficient
batteries to secure and instantaneous, autonomous green energy transactions across prosumers as energy mar-
ket conditions change. We aim to connect prosumers to a decentralized ebike energy-to-grid platform (DEEP)
using blockchain technology. We introduce an integrated smart-testnet mini-grid connecting electric hubs to
open-source energy blockchain platforms containing producers and consumers. We outline the bottlenecks, the
improvements needed, and a roadmap for the future of coupling ebike networks to decentralized open-source
computer and power networks.
