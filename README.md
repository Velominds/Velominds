## Summary
* AIM: Sustainable custom-driven eroica velos converted to e-velo
* REPO: https://github.com/melian009/Velominds
* DATA: https://drive.switch.ch/index.php/s/pQRYseKpMuRXWxH

## Stages

* Online service to build custom-driven bicycles. Check the gallery at ... for examples
* Garage to widen the variety of models and features

## Vision
Custom-driven velos, velominds, target high-end NOS components and frames from mid-century to late 90's to bring eroica velos back to the road. This process minimizes the use of raw material and energy. At short-medium term, velominds converts custom-driven eroica to e-velo. 

At long-term velominds attempts to green power generation, storage and distribution, contributing to the decentralization of power
sources of producers and consumers, and to the formation of the prosumers. In such systems, it will be important to connect efficient decentralized micro-energy power generators and batteries to secure autonomous green energy transactions across prosumers as energy market 
conditions change. We aim to connect prosumers to a decentralized ebike energy-to-grid platform (DEEP) using blockchain technology.

## Next-gen technology
We aim to introduce an integrated smart-testnet mini-grid connecting pedal power gearbox turbine generators to
open-source energy blockchain platforms containing producers and consumers. Outline the bottlenecks, the
improvements needed, and a roadmap for the future of coupling ebike networks to decentralized open-source
computer and power networks.

————————----- Milestones -----------------------------------------------------------------
1. Data analysis: Power-rpm-speed curves (humans)
2. Prototype: Pedal power gearbox turbine (Power-rpm-speed curves)
3. Blockchain: Connecting ebike gearbox power generator to decentralized energy platforms
(i.e., Hyperledger fabric, Tobalaba, Grid+, Powr)

## Interdisciplinarity

* NOS high-end components back to the road
* Network and data science: integration networks and data (urban, bicyle, power and energy distribution)
* Computer science: blockchain–app code and VESC open-software
* Electric engineer: pedal power gearbox turbine, inverters, generators and micro-grids

## Sustainability

* C02 reduction along all energy cycle
* Green energy
* Local smart grid development
* Bottom-up: individual-community prosumers
* Urban bike network development
* Research about efficiency and smart meters by tracking and sharing energy production-consumption data
* Real time price in the green energy markey by connecting many-to-many battery types-decentralized-green
energy platforms
* Supporting deregulation EU energy production 
* Frame architecture-design oriented to produce energy


## Challenges

* Low efficiency dual battery
* Low energy recovery (check prototype data using gearbox turbine)
* Energy production mostly for large kms/day
* Absence of inverter-energy-to-grid networks in urban landscapes
