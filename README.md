Summary
Green power generation, storage and distribution will be composed of millions of small, decentralised power
sources of producers and consumers, the prosumers. In such systems, it will be important to connect efficient decentralized micro-energy power generators 
and batteries to secure autonomous green energy transactions across prosumers as energy market 
conditions change. We aim to connect prosumers to a decentralized ebike energy-to-grid platform (DEEP)
using blockchain technology. We introduce an integrated smart-testnet mini-grid connecting pedal power gearbox turbine generators to
open-source energy blockchain platforms containing producers and consumers. We outline the bottlenecks, the
improvements needed, and a roadmap for the future of coupling ebike networks to decentralized open-source
computer and power networks.


————————----- Milestones -----------------------------------------------------------------
1. Data analysis: Power-rpm-speed curves (humans)
2. Prototype: Pedal power gearbox turbine (Power-rpm-speed curves)
3. Blockchain: Connecting ebike gearbox power generator to decentralized energy platforms
(i.e., Hyperledger fabric, Tobalaba, Grid+, Powr)
