A generator is connected to a stationary bicycle in such a way as the circular rotation of the front wheel rotates the coils of wires inside the generator between the poles of the magnets inside the generator. The resulting Direct Current is channeled to the attached battery bank and converted into different usable DC voltage levels as well as AC voltage, just to increase the number of electrical appliances possible to connect.},

@article{Mocanu2015,
abstract = {– Finding new energy sources is an important challenge of our times. A lot of research focuses on identifying such sources that can also be exploited with relatively simple and efficient systems. These sources can be either new materials that can be used to generate energy, or solutions to scavenge already existing forms of energy. Part of the latter class of solutions, the system presented in this paper converts the energy consumed by many people in gyms (or even at home, during exercise) into electric energy. This energy exists anyway, because people want to be healthier or to look better. Currently, this significant (in our opinion) amount of energy is actually wasted and transformed into heat. Instead, in this study, a prototype scavenging system (dedicated to fitness/stationary bikes) to collect and (re)use this energy is presented. Specifically, we depict the design of a low-budget system that uses existing, discrete components and is able to scavenge some of the energy spent by the biker. The experimental results show that the system is functional, but its efficiency is limited by (mechanical) losses before the collection.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study is to determine the amount of electric power that a stationary bike can produce. The end goal is to determine if it is feasible to power an entire "green gym" using only stationary bikes. This study is significant because the process of configuring a stationary bike to produce electricity is simple, and therefore, could potentially be implemented in gyms worldwide. Non renewable energy sources are quickly depleting, and the search for alternative energy is at its height, which is precisely why this study is of importance. The energy generated by pedalling the bike was captured and converted into electrical energy using a DC generator. Power input and electric power output were measured using a power meter and an electrical load circuit along with a data acquisition system respectively. The efficiency was determined to be (51±4.3){\%} within a confidence interval of 95{\%}. Five male subjects of age 19.5 ± 0.5 years participated in the study. Each produced 54 watts on average over the course of a 10 minute workout. Considering a small gym would require approximately 265 watts, it would require five bikes to continuously power the gym. This result proves that pedal power can be utilized as an alternative energy source for low power consumption applications.},

@article{Boldea2017,
abstract = {Abstract—Starting with Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction in 1831, electric (electromagnetic) machines have been developed ever since as “assembles” of electric and magnetic coupled circuits that convert mechanical to electrical energy (in generators) and vice versa (in motors), via magnetic energy storage. Generators and motors are reversible. The Maxwell four equations (laws) later in 19th Century have prompted the rapid development of all basic (DC. brush and travelling field AC machines by 1900. Then by 1930 AC (alternating current) power (energy) systems evolved by connecting in parallel electric synchronous generators (with voltage boost and buck electric transformers for efficient AC power transmission lines) of rather constant frequency and voltage, driven by turbines (prime movers) that harness fossil (coal, gas or nuclear fuels), thermal or hydro energy. The last 50 years have witnessed a dramatic extension of generators power/unit, renewable energy generators and of variable speed AC motor drives in applications with variable output such as ventilators, pumps compressors, conveyors, orr- mills, electric transport (mobility), industrial automation, robotics, home appliances and info – gadgets. This formidable development, required by the need of more but cleaner energy, was mainly driven by power electronics, better materials, better modeling, design methodologies and digital control. This humble inaugural overview attempts to combine a brief history of electrical generators and motors with recent progress and trends in their design and control, for representative applications.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. The emergence of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) is unveiling new opportunities to de-carbonise the vehicle parcs and promote sustainability in different parts of the globe. As battery technologies and PEV efficiency continue to improve, the use of electric cars as distributed energy resources is fast becoming a reality. While the distribution network operators (DNOs) strive to ensure grid balancing and reliability, the PEV owners primarily aim at maximising their economic benefits. However, given that the PEV batteries have limited capacities and the distribution network is constrained, smart techniques are required to coordinate the charging/discharging of the PEVs. Using the economic model predictive control (EMPC) technique, this paper proposes a decentralised optimisation algorithm for PEVs during the grid-To-vehicle (G2V) and vehicle-To-grid (V2G) operations. To capture the operational dynamics of the batteries, it considers the state-of-charge (SoC) at a given time as a discrete state space and investigates PEVs performance in V2G and G2V operations. In particular, this study exploits the variability in the energy tariff across different periods of the day to schedule V2G/G2V cycles using real data from the university's PEV infrastructure. The results show that by charging/discharging the vehicles during optimal time partitions, prosumers can take advantage of the price elasticity of supply to achieve net savings of about 63{\%}.},

abstract = {Computer-assisted studies of structure, function and evolution of viruses remains a neglected area of research. The attention of bioinformaticians to this interesting and challenging field is far from commensurate with its medical and biotechnological importance. It is telling that out of {\textgreater}200 talks held at ISMB 2013, the largest international bioinformatics conference, only one presentation explicitly dealt with viruses. In contrast to many broad, established and well-organized bioinformatics communities (e.g. structural genomics, ontologies, next-generation sequencing, expression analysis), research groups focusing on viruses can probably be counted on the fingers of two hands.The purpose of this review is to increase awareness among bioinformatics researchers about the pressing needs and unsolved problems of computational virology. We focus primarily on RNA viruses that pose problems to many standard bioinformatics analyses owing to their compact genome organization, fast mutation rate and low evolutionary conservation. We provide an overview of tools and algorithms for handling viral sequencing data, detecting functionally important RNA structures, classifying viral proteins into families and investigating the origin and evolution of viruses.},
